# OurPlaces
OurPlaces is the a cross-cultural crowdsourcing platform where people from different cultures can share their spatial experiences.

The OurPlaces crowdsourcing platform is built based on Java and contains two services: web service and background service. On the web service side, we use Apache Tomcat and Java Server Pages. We decided to use the MySQL database on the background service side to store all datasets collected because it has high reliability and security and on-demand scalability. To handle multiple accesses and tasks with large numbers of data, we decided to use the model-view-controller model for our system.
